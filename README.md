# Fruit Frenzy VR

Fruit Frenzy VR is a fast-paced, arcade-style virtual reality game developed in Unity. Built for the Meta Quest 2, players slice flying fruit in an immersive, low-poly environment using hand-tracking powered by Meta’s All-in-One SDK. Inspired by the simplicity and addictiveness of Fruit Ninja, this game was designed and developed in a 2-week sprint for UCR CS135.

## Features

- Hand-tracked fruit slicing using Meta’s SDK
- Low-poly stylized 3D art optimized for VR
